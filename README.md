# Danbooru-Purify
## The simplest user script ever to blur all explicit images on Danbooru.
Usage:
* Use your favorite userscript extension (I like TamperMonkey)
* [Install the script](https://github.com/JamElyZEuS/Danbooru-Purify/raw/main/myscr.user.js) (or [this edition](https://github.com/JamElyZEuS/Danbooru-Purify/raw/main_plus/myscr.user.js) that also filters questionable works)
* Done

Images unblur when hovering on them.

**Disclaimer:** not all explicit images will be blurred, because some works have wrong rating tags or don't have them at all.

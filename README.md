# Danbooru-AntiPurify
## The simplest user script ever to blur all general images on Danbooru.
Usage:
* Use your favorite userscript extension (I like TamperMonkey)
* [Install the script](https://github.com/JamElyZEuS/Danbooru-Purify/raw/main/myscr.user.js)
* Done

Images unblur when hovering on them.
